## 📌 About The Project

**Dine Grid** is a full-featured restaurant tech platform that eliminates physical waiting by giving diners a virtual queue experience and giving restaurant owners complete control over their floor in real time.

### The Problem It Solves
- Diners waste time standing in line with no visibility on wait time
- Restaurants lose revenue on empty tables during late-night hours
- Food goes to waste when last-minute bookings don't fill seats

### The Solution
- 📲 Join a virtual queue from anywhere — get notified when your table is ready
- 🌙 Claim discounted late-night rescue meals before they go to waste
- 🧑‍🍳 Restaurant owners manage capacity, queues, and deals from one dashboard

## 🎨 Design System — Culina Fresh

Dine Grid uses the **Culina Fresh** design system — a token-based system ensuring visual consistency across every screen.

### Color Palette

| Role | Token Name | Hex | Swatch |
|---|---|---|---|
| 🟢 Primary | `--color-primary` | `#4CAF50` | ![](https://placehold.co/80x18/4CAF50/4CAF50.png) |

| 🩷 Tertiary | `--color-tertiary` | `#F26F9D` | ![](https://placehold.co/80x18/F26F9D/F26F9D.png) |
| ⚫ Neutral | `--color-neutral` | `#1A1C1C` | ![](https://placehold.co/80x18/1A1C1C/1A1C1C.png) |
